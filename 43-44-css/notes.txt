If you want to have an inline element who's width you can control then you can use the inline block display property

when using the position property:
    - relative positioning is postioning the div relative to where it originally should be
    - absolute positioning is positioning the div relative to it's parent element

When specifying fonts, they can be rendered differently on different systems so you can actually declare backup fonts in
case the primary font is not available on the users system. you can have more than one backup
